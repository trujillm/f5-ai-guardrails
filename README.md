## Detailed description

Imagine a financial services team deploying an AI-powered assistant to help underwriters review policies, analyze risk documents, and answer questions about compliance guidelines. The assistant uses a large language model served on Red Hat® OpenShift® AI, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounding its answers in the firm's own document corpus—underwriting manuals, regulatory filings, and internal procedures. Before moving the application to production, a compliance review reveals that the inference endpoint was configured incorrectly: a crafted prompt could trigger cross-site scripting or SQL injection, an undocumented API path may leak model metadata, and there is nothing stopping a single client from flooding the endpoint with thousands of requests.

This AI quickstart demonstrates a solution using F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) Web App & API Protection. It deploys a complete RAG chatbot on OpenShift AI and secures the model inference endpoints. You get a working application you can demonstrate to security, compliance, and risk stakeholders—complete with simulated attack scenarios that show exactly how each protection layer responds to threats from external attackers and internal misuse alike.

While the included demo content targets financial services, the same architecture applies to any industry handling sensitive data—healthcare organizations protecting patient records, government agencies securing citizen-facing AI services, or any enterprise that needs to lock down LLM endpoints before moving to production.

This quickstart allows you to explore security capabilities by:

- Querying financial documents through a RAG-powered chat assistant and seeing grounded, context-aware answers
- Simulating XSS and SQL injection attacks against the inference endpoint, then enabling a WAF policy to block them
- Uploading an OpenAPI specification to enforce API contracts and automatically block undocumented shadow APIs
- Configuring rate limiting to prevent endpoint abuse and ensure fair resource allocation across clients
- Walking through each scenario end-to-end with the included [security use case guide](docs/securing_model_inference_use_cases.md)

The solution is built on:

- **Red Hat OpenShift AI** – MLOps platform with KServe/vLLM model serving and GPU acceleration
- **F5 Distributed Cloud API Security** – WAF, API spec enforcement, rate limiting, and sensitive data controls
- **LLaMA Stack + Streamlit** – RAG chatbot interface backed by PGVector for semantic document retrieval
- **Helm-based deployment** – One-command install and teardown on any OpenShift cluster

## Requirements

### Minimum hardware requirements

- **LLM inference**: GPU node (e.g. NVIDIA L4 or equivalent; see Supported Models table). The 70B model requires A100 x2 or equivalent.
- **Embedding-only**: CPU is sufficient for `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- **Cluster resources**: minimum 8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM, 100 GB disk for model weights and vector database.

### Minimum software requirements

- OpenShift Client CLI ([oc](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#installing-openshift-cli))
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18+
- Red Hat OpenShift AI 2.16+ (tested with 2.22)
- Helm CLI

- Optional: [huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli), [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for example scripts

### Required user permissions

- Regular user for default deployment
- Cluster admin for advanced configurations (e.g. F5 XC integration)


## Deploy

### Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI installed
- `oc` logged into the cluster
- Helm installed
- Hugging Face token and access to [Meta Llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct/) (and optionally [Llama Guard](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B/) for safety)

### Supported models

| Function   | Model Name                             | Hardware    | AWS example      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Embedding | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`                     | CPU/GPU/HPU | —                |
| Generation| `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`     | L4/HPU      | g6.2xlarge       |
| Generation| `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`     | L4/HPU      | g6.2xlarge       |
| Generation| `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct` | A100 x2/HPU | p4d.24xlarge     |
| Safety    | `meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B`          | L4/HPU      | g6.2xlarge       |

The 70B model is not required for initial testing. Llama-Guard-3-8B is optional.

### Installation steps

1. **Log in to OpenShift**
   ```bash
   oc login --token=<your_sha256_token> --server=<cluster-api-endpoint>
   ```

2. **Clone and go to the deployment directory**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/f5-api-security.git
   cd f5-api-security/deploy/helm
   ```

3. **Configure and deploy**
   ```bash
   cp rag-values.yaml.example rag-values.yaml
   vim rag-values.yaml   # or your preferred editor
   ```

   **Deploying Models Locally** — In `rag-values.yaml`, enable the following models by setting `enabled: true`:

   - `llama-3-2-1b-instruct-quantized` (RedHatAI/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-quantized.w8a8)
   - `llama-3-2-3b-instruct` (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct)

       ```yaml
       global:
         models:
           # 1 GPU, ~2–3 GB VRAM (w8a8 quantized)
           llama-3-2-1b-instruct-quantized:
             id: RedHatAI/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-quantized.w8a8
             enabled: true

           # 1 GPU, ~6–8 GB VRAM (FP16)
           llama-3-2-3b-instruct:
             id: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
             enabled: true
       ```
       > **Note:** If your GPU node has a taint (e.g., `nvidia.com/gpu`), you must specify the corresponding toleration in the model configuration for pods to be scheduled on that node. See `rag-values.yaml` for toleration block examples.

   **Deploying a Remote LLM** — In `rag-values.yaml`, enable a remote LLM model by setting `enabled: true` and supplying the URL and API token:

   - `remoteLLM` (<MODEL_ORG>/<MODEL_ID>)
       
       ```yaml
       global:
         models:
           # No local GPU required (runs on remote server)
           remoteLLM:
             id: <MODEL_ID>
             url: <MODEL_SERVER_URL>
             apiToken: <API_TOKEN>
             enabled: true
       ```

   ```bash
   make install NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE>
   ```

   The Makefile checks dependencies (helm, oc), creates the namespace, updates Helm dependencies, and installs the chart. Success looks like:
   ```bash
   [SUCCESS] rag installed successfully
   ```

4. **Verify (optional)**  
   List models:
   ```bash
   curl -sS http://llamastack-<NAMESPACE>.<YOUR_OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER>.com/v1/models
   ```
   Test chat (LlamaStack):
   ```bash
   curl -sS http://llamastack-<NAMESPACE>.<YOUR_OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER>.com/v1/openai/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "<MODEL_ID>", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one sentence."}], "max_tokens": 64, "temperature": 0}' | jq
   ```
   For the secured vLLM endpoint, use your route and model ID in the same request format.

5. **Next steps**
   - **Step 2:** [Deployment and Configuration of F5 Distributed Cloud](docs/f5_xc_deployment.md)
   - **Step 3:** [Security Use Cases and Testing](docs/securing_model_inference_use_cases.md)

**Application access:** Get the route with `oc get route -n <NAMESPACE>`, open the URL in a browser, and configure LLM settings (XC URL, model ID, API key) in the web UI.

### Delete

Remove the quickstart from the cluster:

```bash
cd f5-api-security/deploy/helm
make uninstall NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE>
```

This uninstalls the Helm release and removes pods, services, routes, and the pgvector PVC. To delete the namespace:

```bash
oc delete project <NAMESPACE>
```
